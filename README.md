# solid-viewer-next

Deploy your decentralized blog in a single click thanks to Arweave and Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F0x3studio%2Fsolid-viewer-next&env=WALLET_ADDRESS,TITLE,GATEWAY_URL&envDescription=Information%20needed%20for%20the%20application%20to%20run.)

You'll be asked 3 different things:

* `WALLET_ADDRESS`: your Ethereum wallet address
* `TITLE`: the title of your blog, for example "John's blog"
* `GATEWAY_URL`: the URL of the gateway to get the data (you can use https://solidgateway.0x3.studio for now but in the future, you'll be able to deploy your own gateway as well)
